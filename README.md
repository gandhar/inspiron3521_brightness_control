inspiron3521_display_backlight_linux
====================================
the brightness keys on inspiron 3521 running x/l/ubuntu linux do not work as intended,
this little script fixes that problem, put your password in the script in 
echo "PASSWORD" | ,,,,,,,
or run it as root. 
make the script executable with  chmod +x brightness.sh
